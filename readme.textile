This (small) project is here to create a P2-update site for third party libraries used by the Elexis project.
The output can be found under http://download.elexis.info/elexis.3rdparty.libraries.

It is part of the Elexis 3.0 release planned for end of 2013.

The p2-update site service is sponsored by Medelexis AG. Thanks a lot!

To build it you need maven >= 3.0. Then call @mvn clean install p2:site@. (Needs Ruby to execute get_ag_ion.rb)

To add another item simply edit the pom and add another line of the form:
@<artifact><id>group-id:artifact-id:version</id></artifact>@

To test it call @mvn jetty:run@ and you should be able to use it as a p2 site by adding http://localhost:8080/site/ to your target file.

For questions and suggestions send an e-mail to elexis-develop@lists.sourceforge.net.

h2. Remarks

Our main goal is to generate a P2-site which contains plugins for all Elexis features (OpenSource and closed source, to avoid duplication).

h3. AG_ION

We use the ruby script @get_ag_ion.rb@ to download the needed jar files, which later get packed using the p2-maven-plugin.

h3. google-calendar

Handling the google-calendar plugins consists of the following steps:

* Download google_calendar_v3.zip to from "developers.google.com":https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/download/calendar/v3/java
* Unzip it into the @target@ directory unsing the antrun plugin
* Install each of the files, e.g. @target/calendar/libs/google-api-client-1.20.0.jar@ as a temporary jar with the groupId @elexis_3rdparty@
* Add it to to p2 site (using the p2-maven-plugin) and add special instruction to set it's SymbolicName and Version using the following code snippet

bc. <artifact><source>false</source><id>elexis_3rdparty:google-api-client:1.20.0</id>
 <instructions>
    <Bundle-SymbolicName>com.google.api.client</Bundle-SymbolicName>
    <Bundle-Version>1.20.0</Bundle-Version>
